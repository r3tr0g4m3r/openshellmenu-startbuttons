### What are these icons?

This are some start buttons replacements for use with Open Shell.
## Installation

To start, you will need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly regarded Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the png files to a directory of your choosing like `%USERPROFILE%\pictures` and choose it from the "Replace Start Button" option from inside the Open Shell configuration menu.

**done!** The button will be applied.
